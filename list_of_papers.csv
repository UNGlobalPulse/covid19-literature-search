The emergence of Zika virus in South America in 2015 marked the largest known Zika outbreak and caused hundreds of thousands of infections. Internet data have shown promise in identifying human behaviors relevant for tracking and understanding other diseases. OBJECTIVE: Using Twitter posts regarding the 2015-16 Zika virus outbreak, we sought to identify and describe considerations and self-disclosures of a specific behavior change relevant to the spread of disease—travel cancellation. If this type of behavior is identifiable in Twitter, this approach may provide an additional source of data for disease modeling. METHODS: We combined keyword filtering and machine learning classification to identify first-person reactions to Zika in 29,386 English-language tweets in the context of travel, including considerations and reports of travel cancellation. We further explored demographic, network, and linguistic characteristics of users who change their behavior compared with control groups. RESULTS: We found differences in the demographics, social networks, and linguistic patterns of 1567 individuals identified as changing or considering changing travel behavior in response to Zika as compared with a control sample of Twitter users. We found significant differences between geographic areas in the United States, significantly more discussion by women than men, and some evidence of differences in levels of exposure to Zika-related information. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for informing the ways in which public health organizations communicate with the public on social media, and the findings contribute to our understanding of the ways in which the public perceives and acts on risks of emerging infectious diseases.",2019-05-13,"Daughton, Ashlynn R; Paul, Michael J",J Med Internet Res,,,,False,True,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535980/,AI
11211,bidvi76z,,PMC,Use of Big Data and Machine Learning Methods in the Monitoring and Evaluation of Digital Health Programs in India: An Exploratory Protocol,10.2196/11456,PMC6555122,31127716.0,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Digital health programs, which encompass the subsectors of health information technology, mobile health, electronic health, telehealth, and telemedicine, have the potential to generate “big data.” OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to evaluate two digital health programs in India—the maternal mobile messaging service (Kilkari) and the mobile training resource for frontline health workers (Mobile Academy). We illustrate possible applications of machine learning for public health practitioners that can be applied to generate evidence on program effectiveness and improve implementation. Kilkari is an outbound service that delivers weekly gestational age–appropriate audio messages about pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare directly to families on their mobile phones, starting from the second trimester of pregnancy until the child is one year old. Mobile Academy is an Interactive Voice Response audio training course for accredited social health activists (ASHAs) in India. METHODS: Study participants include pregnant and postpartum women (Kilkari) as well as frontline health workers (Mobile Academy) across 13 states in India. Data elements are drawn from system-generated databases used in the routine implementation of programs to provide users with health information. We explain the structure and elements of the extracted data and the proposed process for their linkage. We then outline the various steps to be undertaken to evaluate and select final algorithms for identifying gaps in data quality, poor user performance, predictors for call receipt, user listening levels, and linkages between early listening and continued engagement. RESULTS: The project has obtained the necessary approvals for the use of data in accordance with global standards for handling personal data. The results are expected to be published in August/September 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous evaluations of digital health programs are limited, and few have included applications of machine learning. By describing the steps to be undertaken in the application of machine learning approaches to the analysis of routine system-generated data, we aim to demystify the use of machine learning not only in evaluating digital health education programs but in improving their performance. Where articles on analysis offer an explanation of the final model selected, here we aim to emphasize the process, thereby illustrating to program implementors and evaluators with limited exposure to machine learning its relevance and potential use within the context of broader program implementation and evaluation.

Commonly used exoskeletons have a left-right pair, but when only one leg of the wearer is uncomfortable, it is effective to wear the exoskeleton on only the uncomfortable leg. The designed exoskeleton uses a lightweight material and uses a wire-driven actuator, which reduces the weight of the driving section that is attached on the knee directly. Therefore, proposed exoskeleton reduces the force of inertia that the wearer experiences. In addition, the lower frame length of the exoskeleton can be changed to align with the complex movement of the knee. Furthermore, the length between the knee center of rotation and the ankle (LBKA) is measured by using this structure, and the LBKA values are used as the data for intention detection. These value helps to detect the intention because it changes faster than a motor encoder value. A neural network was trained using the motor encoder values, and LBKA values.

Numerous studies have been conducted to detect the user’s emotions from physiological data. Among a myriad of target emotions, boredom, in particular, has been suggested to cause not only medical issues but also challenges in various facets of daily life. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) together for boredom classification, although these data have potential features for emotion classification. To investigate the combined effect of these features on boredom classification, we collected EEG and GSR data from 28 participants using off-the-shelf sensors. During data acquisition, we used a set of stimuli comprising a video clip designed to elicit boredom and two other video clips of entertaining content. The collected samples were labeled based on the participants’ questionnaire-based testimonies on experienced boredom levels. Using the collected data, we initially trained 30 models with 19 machine learning algorithms and selected the top three candidate classifiers. After tuning the hyperparameters, we validated the final models through 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross validation to increase the robustness of the test results. Our results indicated that a Multilayer Perceptron model performed the best with a mean accuracy of 79.98% (AUC: 0.781). It also revealed the correlation between boredom and the combined features of EEG and GSR.

Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R(0) ≤ 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms.

TLR9 activates the innate immune system following the recognition of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs. Due to the considerable number of rotatable bonds in ODNs, high-throughput in silico screening for potential TLR9 activity via traditional structure-based virtual screening approaches of CpG ODNs is challenging. In the current study, we present a machine learning based method for predicting novel mouse TLR9 (mTLR9) agonists based on features including count and position of motifs, the distance between the motifs and graphically derived features such as the radius of gyration and moment of Inertia. We employed an in-house experimentally validated dataset of 396 single-stranded synthetic ODNs, to compare the results of five machine learning algorithms. Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, we used an ensemble learning approach based on repeated random down-sampling. RESULTS: Using in-house experimental TLR9 activity data we found that random forest algorithm outperformed other algorithms for our dataset for TLR9 activity prediction. Therefore, we developed a cross-validated ensemble classifier of 20 random forest models. The average Matthews correlation coefficient and balanced accuracy of our ensemble classifier in test samples was 0.61 and 80.0%, respectively, with the maximum balanced accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient of 87.0% and 0.75, respectively. We confirmed common sequence motifs including ‘CC’, ‘GG’,‘AG’, ‘CCCG’ and ‘CGGC’ were overrepresented in mTLR9 agonists. Predictions on 6000 randomly generated ODNs were ranked and the top 100 ODNs were synthesized and experimentally tested for activity in a mTLR9 reporter cell assay, with 91 of the 100 selected ODNs showing high activity, confirming the accuracy of the model in predicting mTLR9 activity. CONCLUSION: We combined repeated random down-sampling with random forest to overcome the class imbalance problem and achieved promising results. Overall, we showed that the random forest algorithm outperformed other machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, shrinkage discriminant analysis, gradient boosting machine and neural networks. Due to its predictive performance and simplicity, the random forest technique is a useful method for prediction of mTLR9 ODN agonists.",2019-12-20,"Khanna, Varun; Li, Lei; Fung, Johnson; Ranganathan, Shoba; Petrovsky, Nikolai",BMC Mol Cell Biol,,,,True,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6924143/,AI

Exploring how the awareness of risk spreads and how it triggers a diffusion of coping strategies is prominent in the research agenda of various domains. It requires a deep understanding of how individuals perceive risks and communicate about the effectiveness of protective measures, highlighting learning and social interaction as the core mechanisms driving such processes. Methodological approaches that range from purely physics-based diffusion models to data-driven environmental methods rely on agent-based modeling to accommodate context-dependent learning and social interactions in a diffusion process. Mixing agent-based modeling with data-driven machine learning has become popularity. However, little attention has been paid to the role of intelligent learning in risk appraisal and protective decisions, whether used in an individual or a collective process. The differences between collective learning and individual learning have not been sufficiently explored in diffusion modeling in general and in agent-based models of socio-environmental systems in particular. To address this research gap, we explored the implications of intelligent learning on the gradient from individual to collective learning, using an agent-based model enhanced by machine learning. Our simulation experiments showed that individual intelligent judgement about risks and the selection of coping strategies by groups with majority votes were outperformed by leader-based groups and even individuals deciding alone. Social interactions appeared essential for both individual learning and group learning. The choice of how to represent social learning in an agent-based model could be driven by existing cultural and social norms prevalent in a modeled society.",2020-01-06,"Abdulkareem, Shaheen A.; Augustijn, Ellen-Wien; Filatova, Tatiana; Musial, Katarzyna; Mustafa, Yaseen T.",PLoS One,,,,True,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6944362/,AI

An exhaustive dataset of mammal–pathogen interactions was transformed into networks where hosts are linked via their shared pathogens. We present a methodology for identifying important and influential hosts in these networks. Ensemble models linking network characteristics with phylogeny and life-history traits are then employed to predict those key hosts and quantify the roles they undertake in pathogen transmission. Our models reveal drivers explaining host importance and demonstrate how these drivers vary by pathogen taxa.

The types of data in these models are expanding to include health-related information from open-source internet data and information on mobility patterns of humans and goods. This information is helping to identify susceptible populations and predict the pathways from which infections might spread into new areas and new countries. As a powerful addition to traditional surveillance strategies that identify what has already happened, it is anticipated that EBS systems and risk modelling will increasingly be used to inform public health actions to prevent, detect and mitigate the climate change increases in infectious diseases.",2019-05-02,"Rees, EE; Ng, V; Gachon, P; Mawudeku, A; McKenney, D; Pedlar, J; Yemshanov, D; Parmely, J; Knox, J",Canada Communicable Disease Report,,,,True,False,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v45i05a02,AI

OBJECTIVE: To test our hypothesis that themes of polio-related tweets and media articles would differ by location of interest (hashtag of country name mentioned in the tweet; country name mentioned in media articles) but would be similar to each other (tweets and media articles) for each location of interest. METHODS: We retrospectively examined a 40% random sample of Twitter data containing the hashtag #polio from January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015 (N = 79,333), from which we extracted 5 subcorpora each with a co-occurring hashtag #India (n = 5027), #Iraq (n = 1238), #Nigeria (n = 1364), #Pakistan (n = 11,427), and #Syria (n = 2952). We also retrieved and categorized 73 polio-related English-language news stories from within the same timeframe. We assessed the association between polio-related English news themes and the Twitter content. Descriptive analyses and unsupervised machine learning (latent Dirichlet allocation modeling) were conducted on the 5 Twitter subcorpora. RESULTS: The results of the latent Dirichlet allocation modeling on the specific subcorpora with country co-occurring hashtags showed significant differences between the 5 countries in terms of content. English mass media content focused largely on violence/conflicts and cases of polio, whereas social media focused on eradication and vaccination efforts along with celebrations.

To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. METHODS: We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic. RESULTS: We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction. CONCLUSIONS: Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes.

The implementation of auxiliary diagnosis support algorithm for medical text data faces challenges with interpretability and creditability. The improvement of clinical diagnostic techniques means not only the improvement of diagnostic accuracy but also the further study of diagnostic basis. Traditional research methods for diagnostic markers often require a large amount of time and economic costs. Research objects are often dozens of samples, and it is, therefore, difficult to synthesize large amounts of data. Therefore, the comprehensiveness and reliability of traditional methods have yet to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of a model that can automatically diagnose diseases and automatically provide a diagnostic basis at the same time has a positive effect on the improvement of medical diagnostic techniques. METHODS: Here, we established an auxiliary diagnostic tool based on attention deep learning algorithm to diagnostic hyperlipemia and automatically predict the corresponding diagnostic markers using hematological parameters. In this paper, we not only demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to automatically diagnose diseases using text-based medical data, such as physiological parameters, but also demonstrated its ability to forecast disease diagnostic markers. Human physiological parameters are used as input to the model, and the doctor’s diagnosis results as an output. Through the attention layer, the degree of attention of the model to different physiological parameters can be obtained, that is, the model provides a diagnostic basis. RESULTS: It achieved 94% ACC, 97.48% AUC, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity with the test dataset. All the above samples are drawn from clinical practice. Moreover, the model predicted the diagnostic markers of hyperlipidemia by the attention mechanism, and the results were fully agreeable to the golden criteria. DISCUSSION: The auxiliary diagnosis system proposed in this paper not only achieves the accurate and robust performance, and can be used for the preliminary diagnosis of patients, but also showing its great potential to discover new diagnostic markers. Therefore, it not only can improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis but also shorten the research period of researching a diagnosis basis to an extent.

There is a huge anthropomorphic prejudice that although life is unlikely, the just-right Goldilocks terrestrial conditions mean that the just-right balance of minerals and basic small molecules inevitably result in life as we know it throughout our solar system, galaxy, and the rest of the universe. Moreover, when such conditions on planets such as ours may not be quite right for the origin of life, it is popularly opined that asteroids and comets magically produce life or at the very least, the important, if not crucial components of terrestrial life so that life then blooms, when their fragments cruise the solar system, stars, and galaxies, and plummet onto appropriately bedecked planets and moons. It is no longer extraordinary to detect extraterrestrial solar systems. Moreover, since extra-solar system space exploration has commenced, this provides the problem of detecting life with enhanced achievability. Small organisms, which replicate outside of a living cell or host, would not be catalogued as viruses. How about viruses that cohabit with life? On the Earth, viruses are a major, if underestimated, condition of life – will that be the case elsewhere? Detection of extra-solar system viruses, if they exist, requires finding life, since viruses necessitate life to replicate. (It should be noted, though, that viruses could be detected through various types of portable ultra-microscopes, including Electron Microscopes (EM) (scanning and transmission) as well as Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM).) However, extra-solar system detection of life does not oblige that viruses exist ubiquitously. Viruses are important potential components of biospheres because of their multiple interactions and influence on evolution, although viruses are small and obligatory parasitic. In addition, nanotechnology – living or replicating nano-synthetic machine organisms might also be present out there, and require consideration as well. An imposing caveat is that, if found, could some extraterrestrial viruses and synthetic nanotechnological microorganisms infect humans? Possibly, intelligence and cognition may at times be contemporaneous with life. Concomitantly, life and viruses that may be detected, could well be impacted upon by intelligences existing on such exoplanets (and vice versa). Coming to an understanding of the plurality of extraterrestrial intelligence is an optimal objective, in order to avoid causing harm on exoplanets, as well as avoiding conflict and possible human devastation. This is especially the case if we encounter greatly advanced galactic-level civilizations, compared to terrestrial civilizations. Their machine and bionic technologies on the Dyson engineering civilization scale may be prominently superior to ours; their biological expertise may be similarly critically radical. For example, they may use viruses for purposes for which we are barely aware, and which could be utterly deadly for humans. A series of steps is being taken in space exploration. Scientists hypothesize and claim that types of life may be near the Earth, in the solar system, and outside the solar system, similar to ours in the sense that only such conditions, Goldilocks conditions, are key sine qua non requirements, based on our terrestrial chemistry and biochemistry. If detected within the solar system, will life or its remnants resemble terrestrial life? Outside the solar system a similar chauvinism exists, although the likelihood for life, in any event, remains probably low, according to more cautious approaches to the problem. The study of our solar system includes planets, asteroids, comets, and other planetesimals that have been in overall contiguity during several billion years; anthropomorphisms claims life consequently has been developing along terrestrial-type mechanisms. However, a non-anthropomorphic view would surmise, probably not, especially for extra-solar system locales. The prime warning and admonition in all these deliberations is the contamination and damage, which current and past practice and procedures has caused and continues, due to insufficient biocontainment concepts and technology to date. Advances in the development of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and high capacity ultrafast quantum computers (QC) greatly enhance the sophisticated control and logical development of extra-solar system studies. Consequently, future long-range manned space exploration seems unwarranted. Clearly, reduced dangers to human health and safety, will result from the use of intelligent machine-based investigations and besides, with increased cost-effectiveness. Space exploration comes at great cost to humanity as a whole and utilizes global resources. Consequently, appropriate organizational measures and planning/cooperation need to be in place. Moreover, the bottom line is that despite all the slogans and claims, there have been next to no financial benefits to our planet as a whole. Such financial and heedless difficulties need to be addressed, the sooner the better. In addition, prior to exposure to exoplanetary life, deep understanding of the problems of infectious diseases and immune dysfunction risks are needed. In addition, global efforts should avoid serendipity and stochasticity as this work should be directed with long-term organization, commitment, scientific, and technological methodology.

It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages.

It is thus necessary to promote PPE rational use, highlighting possible differences in terms of efficacy among them and promoting an effective technique to reuse them. Methods A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar and from 25 top cited papers, 15 were selected for relevance and impact. Results Most studies on prior respiratory virus epidemic to date suggest surgical masks not to be inferior compared with N95 respirators in terms of protective efficacy among health care workers. The use of N95 respirators should be then limited in favor of high-risk situations. Concerning respirators reuse, highly energetic short-wave ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was proficiently applied to determine N95 respirators decontamination from viral respiratory agents, but it requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biological target. Conclusions Rational use and successful reuse of respirators can help facing PPE shortening during a pandemic. Further evidences testing UVGI and other decontamination techniques are an unmet need.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM).

In the bioinformatics area, one of the crucial points is the analysis of the virus nucleotide sequences using approaches such as data stream, digital signal processing, and machine learning techniques and algorithms. However, to make feasible this approach, it is necessary to transform the nucleotide sequences string to numerical values representation. Thus, the dataset provides a chaos game representation (CGR) of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleotide sequences.

Materials and methods From January 17 to February 9, 2020, 38 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled in our hospitals. All clinical data and the chest CT on admission were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Firstly, a quantitative method based on multi-scale convolutional neural networks was used to assess the infected lung segments and this was compared with the semi-quantitative method. Secondly, the quantitative method was tested with laboratory results and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) by correlation analyses. Thirdly, both quantitative and semi-quantitative parameters between patients with different PSI were compared. Results Thirty cases were finally enrolled: 16 (53.33%) of them were male, and the mean age was 48 years old. The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 8 days. The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi-quantitative CT score (P < 0.001 for all; rs = 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), CRP (P = 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs = 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P = 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs = 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P = 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs = −0.42, −0.53, −0.48). There was a positive correlation trend between the proportion of total infection and the pneumonia severity index (P = 0.0994; rs = 0.30) and a tendency that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had higher percentage of consolidation and total infection (P = 0.0903, 0.0989).

In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.One Sentence SummaryIt is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM).

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations.

A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm.ResultsWe trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours.AvailabilityThe repository of this project will be published.Contactdongsi@uw.eduSupplementary informationSupplementary data will be available at Bioinformatics online.",2020-02-13,Jonas Pfab; Dong Si,,,,,True,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.946772,AI

No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.Significance StatementThe novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes). Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure. We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses. Analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a potential form of immune evasion.

The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. Materials and Methods We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. Based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based CT diagnosis system (DeepPneumonia) was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. Results The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from others with an excellent AUC of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. In addition, our model was capable of discriminating the COVID-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an AUC of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. Moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis.

It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods.

To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 404 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease severity. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the survival of individual patients with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this paper suggests a simple and operable formula to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritised and potentially reducing the mortality rate.",2020-03-01,Li Yan; Hai-Tao Zhang; Jorge Goncalves; Yang Xiao; Maolin Wang; Yuqi Guo; Chuan Sun; Xiuchuan Tang; Liang Jin; Mingyang Zhang; Xiang Huang; Ying Xiao; Haosen Cao; Yanyan Chen; Tongxin Ren; Fang Wang; Yaru Xiao; Sufang Huang; Xi Tan; Niannian Huang; Bo Jiao; Yong Zhang; Ailin Luo; Laurent Mombaerts; Junyang Jin; Zhiguo Cao; Shusheng Li; Hui Xu; Ye Yuan,,,,,True,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028027,AI

These methods are typically reliant on excising K-length substrings of the input sequence, called K-mers5. In the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for antimicrobial resistance genes6,7,8. This can be seen as an analogy of the “bag-of-words” model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for document and image classification9,10. Feature extraction techniques from natural language processing have previously been analogized to genomics data11; however, the “bag-of-words” approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance and the exact matching requirement of K-mers. To reconcile the simplicity of “bag-of-words” methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K-mers in a way that faithfully reflects an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative ‘degenerate’ K-mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-host vs. non-human host in Influenza A. The capacity of this approach for in silico identification of hypotheses which can be validated by direct experimentation, as well as identification of genomic targets for preemptive biosurveillance of emerging viruses, is discussed.

Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay (≤10 days) and long-term hospital stay (>10 days). Results The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset. The LR model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset.

We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.",2020-03-12,Yiyue Ge; Tingzhong Tian; Suling Huang; Fangping Wan; Jingxin Li; Shuya Li; Hui Yang; Lixiang Hong; Nian Wu; Enming Yuan; Lili Cheng; Yipin Lei; Hantao Shu; Xiaolong Feng; Ziyuan Jiang; Ying Chi; Xiling Guo; Lunbiao Cui; Liang Xiao; Zeng Li; Chunhao Yang; Zehong Miao; Haidong Tang; Ligong Chen; Hainian Zeng; Dan Zhao; Fengcai Zhu; Xiaokun Shen; Jianyang Zeng,,,,,True,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.986836,AI

Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus.

Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus. Experiments on data from the Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify SARS-CoV-2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and SARS-CoV regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). From a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average accuracy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying SARS-CoV-2 with an AUC of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. Then, using the same basis, we classify SARS-CoV-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene ORF1ab from the NCBI with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17% , a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. These preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for SARS-CoV-2. At this end the interaction between viromics and deep learning, will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. In addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Hence, it has been crucial to early identify those cases and give timely treatment for optimizing treatment strategy and reducing mortality. This study aims to establish an AI model to predict mild patients with potential malignant progression. Methods: A total of 133 consecutively mild COVID-19 patients at admission who was hospitalized in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 3 to February 13, 2020, were selected in this retrospective IRB-approved study. All mild patients at admission were categorized into groups with or without malignant progression. The clinical and laboratory data at admission, the first CT, and the follow-up CT at severe/critical stage of the two groups were compared with Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and t test. Both traditional logistic regression and deep learning-based methods were used to build the prediction models. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the models. Results: The deep learning-based method significantly outperformed logistic regression (AUC 0.954 vs. 0.893). The deep learning-based method achieved a prediction AUC of 0.938 by combining the clinical data and the CT data, significantly outperforming its counterpart trained with clinical data only by 0.141. By further considering the temporal information of the CT sequence, our model achieved the best AUC of 0.954. The proposed model can be effectively used for finding out the mild patients who are easy to deteriorate into severe/critical cases, so that such patients get timely treatments while alleviating the limitations of medical resources.",2020-03-23,Xiang Bai; Cong Fang; Yu Zhou; Song Bai; Zaiyi Liu; Qianlan Chen; Yongchao Xu; Tian Xia; Shi Gong; Xudong Xie; Dejia Song; Ronghui Du; Chunhua Zhou; Chengyang Chen; Dianer Nie; Dandan Tu; Changzheng Zhang; Xiaowu Liu; Lixin Qin; Weiwei Chen,,,,,True,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20037325,AI

Any models to identify subjects at risk for COVID-19 in the general population were also included. Design: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 13th March 2020. Study selection: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts. Data extraction: Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and prediction model performance. Results: 1916 titles were screened. Of these, 15 studies describing 19 prediction models were included for data extraction and critical appraisal. We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; nine diagnostic models to detect COVID-19 infection in symptomatic individuals (seven of which were deep learning models for COVID-19 diagnosis utilising computed tomography (CT) results); and seven prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, or length of hospital stay. None of the 15 studies used data on COVID-19 cases outside of China. Predictors included in more than one of the 19 models were: age, sex, comorbidities, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte markers (percentage or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), lactate dehydrogenase, and features derived from CT images. Reported C-index estimates for the prediction models ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in those for the general population (reported for all 3 general population models), from 0.81 to > 0.99 in those for diagnosis (reported for 5 of the 9 diagnostic models), and from 0.90 to 0.98 in those for prognosis (reported for 4 of the 7 prognostic models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and poor statistical analysis, including high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. A description of the study population and intended use of the models was absent in almost all reports, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion: COVID-19 related prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis are quickly entering the academic literature through publications and preprint reports, aiming to support medical decision making in a time where this is needed urgently. Many models were poorly reported and all appraised as high risk of bias. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies worldwide to support collaborative efforts in building more rigously developed and validated COVID-19 related prediction models. The predictors identified in current studies should be considered for potential inclusion in new models.

We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from 7 cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images and gene information were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features. Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5+ days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system. In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014).

These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptoma’s accuracy far exceeds that of simple “yes-no” questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while also considering over 20,000 other diseases. Furthermore, Symptoma allows free text input, furthered with disease-specific follow up questions, in 36 languages.

However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures.

Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario. Materials & Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID- 19. The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set) ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray images. The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19. Conclusion : The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital images of the chest X- rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for the health professionals.

The EnerPol platform has been used in a broad range of case studies in different sectors in all of Europe, USA, Japan, South Korea and sub Saharan Africa over the last 10 years. In the present study, the entire Swiss population (8.57 million people), including cross-border commuters, and the entire Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics. The predictions estimate that between 22 February and 11 April 2020, there will be 720 deaths from 83300 COVID-19 cases, and 73300 will have recovered; our preliminary variability in these estimates is about 21% over the aforementioned period. In the absence of governmental intervention, 42.7% of the Swiss population would have been infected by 25 April 2020 compared to our prediction of a 1% infection over this time period, saving thousands of lives. It is argued that future scenarios regarding relaxation of the lockdown should be carefully simulated, as by 19 April 2020, there will still remain a substantial number of infected individuals, who could retrigger a second spread of COVID-19. Through the use of a digital tool, such as Enerpol, to evaluate in a data-driven manner the impacts of various policy scenarios, the most effective measures to mitigate a spread of COVID-19 can be devised while we await the deployment of large-scale vaccination for the population globally. By tailoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of the spread to match the capacity of local healthcare facilities, appropriate logistic needs can be determined, in order not to overwhelm the health care services across the country.",2020-04-01,Reza S.

Deep learning approaches have shown promise in medicine by transforming collected data into clinically significant information. Objective The objective of this research is to assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm to detect murmurs and clinically significant valvular heart disease using recordings from a commercial digital stethoscope platform. Methods Using over 34 hours of previously acquired and annotated heart sound recordings, we trained a deep neural network to detect murmurs. To test the algorithm, we enrolled 373 patients in a clinical study and collected recordings at the four primary auscultation locations. Ground truth was established using patient echocardiograms and annotations by three expert cardiologists. Results Algorithm performance for detecting murmurs has sensitivity and specificity of 76.3% and 91.4%, respectively. By omitting softer murmurs, those with grade 1, sensitivity increases to 90.0%.

Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of −48.1 kcal/mol (± 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as −82.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of −52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning–driven designs. This technical report is a high-level description of that effort; the Supplementary Materials includes the homology-based structural models we developed and 178,856 in silico free energy calculations for 89,263 mutant antibodies derived from known SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies.",2020-04-10,Thomas Desautels; Adam Zemla; Edmond Lau; Magdalena Franco; Daniel Faissol,,,,,True,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.024885,AI

Therefore it was aimed to develop a machine learning method for the detection of viral epidemics by analyzing X-ray images. In this study, images belonging to 6 situations, including coronavirus images, are classified. Since the number of images in the dataset is deficient and unbalanced, it is more convenient to analyze these images with hand-crafted feature extraction methods. For this purpose, firstly, all the images in the dataset are extracted with the help of four feature extraction algorithms. These extracted features are combined in raw form. The unbalanced data problem is eliminated by producing feature vectors with the SMOTE algorithm. Finally, the feature vector is reduced in size by using a stacked auto-encoder and principal component analysis to remove interconnected features in the feature vector.

The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. Moreover, the publicly available data on infection rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the January 24 till March 3 window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1. Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1 April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020.

Quantifying viral dynamics is of particular importance for the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Effective containment strategies and potential future therapeutic and vaccine strategies will likely require a precise and quantitative understanding of viral transmission and evolution. In this paper, we employ an entropy-based analysis to identify mutational signatures of SARS-CoV-2 strains in the GISAID database available as of April 5, 2020. Our analysis method identifies nucleotide sites within the viral genome which are highly informative of variation between the viral genomes sequenced in different individuals. These sites are used to characterize individual virus sequence with a characteristic Informative Subtype Marker (ISM). The ISMs provide signatures that can be efficiently and rapidly utilized to quantitatively trace viral dynamics through geography and time. We show that by analyzing the ISM of currently available SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we are able to profile international and interregional differences in viral subtype, and visualize the emergence of viral subtypes in different countries over time. To validate and demonstrate the utility of ISM-based subtyping: (1) We show the distinct genetic subtypes of European infections, in which early on infections are related to the viral subtypes that has become dominant in Italy followed by the development of local subtypes, (2) We distinguish subtypes associated with outbreaks in distinct parts of the United States, identify the development of a local subtype potentially due to community to transmission and distinguish it from the predominant subtype in New York, suggesting that the outbreak in New York is linked to imported cases from Europe. (3) We present results that quantitatively show the temporal behavior of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from localization in China to a pattern of distinct regional subtypes as the virus spreads throughout the world over time. Accordingly, we show that genetic subtyping using entropy-based ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as the Nextstrain [9] project, in efficiently quantifying SARS-CoV-2 dynamics to enable modeling, data-mining, and machine learning tools.

Diagnostic performance was computed for a system trained on CXRs of Italian subjects from two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. Methods We used for training and internal testing an ensemble of ten convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with mainly bedside CXRs of 250 COVID-19 and 250 non-COVID-19 subjects from two hospitals. We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as reference standard. Results At 10-fold cross-validation, our AI model classified COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85) and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91).

Epidemiological figures of Covid19 epidemic in Italy are worse than those observed in China. Methods. We modeled the Covid19 outbreak in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics progression and predict peaks of new daily infections and total cases by learning from the entire Chinese epidemiological dynamics. We trained an artificial neural network model, a modified auto-encoder with Covid19 Chinese data, to forecast epidemic curve of the different Italian regions, and use the susceptible/exposed/infected/removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading and peaks. We have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection - both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a one month period, and also by using a day by day assessment, based on single observations.

Despite governmental initiatives aimed at containing the spread of the disease, several countries are experiencing unmanageable increases in the demand for ICU beds, medical equipment, and larger testing capacity. Efficient COVID-19 diagnosis enables healthcare systems to provide better care for patients while protecting caregivers from the disease. However, many countries are constrained by the limited amount of test kits available, the lack of equipment and trained professionals. In the case of patients visiting emergency rooms (ERs) with a suspect of COVID-19, a prompt diagnosis can improve the outcome and even provide information for efficient hospital management. In this context, a quick, inexpensive and readily available test to perform an initial triage at ER could help to smooth patient flow, provide better patient care, and reduce the backlog of exams. Methods: In this Case-control quantitative study, we developed a strategy backed by artificial intelligence to perform an initial screening of suspect COVID-19 cases. We developed a machine learning classifier that takes widely available simple blood exams as input and predicts if that suspect case is likely to be positive (having SARS-CoV-2) or negative(not having SARS-CoV-2). Based on this initial classification, positive cases can be referred for further highly sensitive testing (e.g. CT scan, or specific antibodies). We used publicly available data from the Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil from 5,644 patients. Focussing on using simple blood exams, a sample of 599 subjects that had the fewest missing values for 16 common exams were selected. From these 599 patients, only 81 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (determined by RT-PCR). Based on this data, we built an artificial intelligence classification framework, ER-CoV, aiming at determining which patients were more likely to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 when visiting an ER and that were categorized as a suspect case by medical professionals. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop a classifier with high specificity and high negative predictive values, with reasonable sensitivity. Findings: We identified that our framework achieved an average specificity of 92.16% [95% CI 91.73 - 92.59] and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.29% [95% CI 94.65% - 95.90%]. Those values are completely aligned with our goal of providing an effective low-cost system to triage suspected patients at ERs. As for sensitivity, our model achieved an average of 63.98% [95% CI 59.82% - 67.50%] and positive predictive value (PPV) of 48.00% [95% CI 44.88% - 51.56%]. An error analysis identified that, on average, 45% of the false negative results would have been hospitalized anyway, thus the model is making mistakes for severe cases that would not be overlooked, partially mitigating the fact that the test is not high-sensitive. All code for our AI model, called ER-CoV is publicly available at https://github.com/soares-f/ER-CoV. Interpretation: Based on the capacity of our model to accurately predict which cases are negative from suspected patients arriving at emergency rooms, we envision that this framework can play an important role in patient triage. Probably the most important outcome is related to testing availability, which at this point is extremely low in many countries. Considering the achieved specificity, we would reduce by at least 90% the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at emergency rooms, with the chance of getting a false negative at around 5%. The second important outcome is related to patient management in hospitals. Patients predicted as positive by our framework could be immediately separated from the other patients while waiting for the results of confirmatory tests. This could reduce the spread rate inside hospitals since in many hospitals all suspected cases are kept in the same ward. In Brazil, where the data was collected, rate infection is starting to quickly spread, the lead time of a SARS-CoV-2 can be up to 2 weeks.

Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 is performed with a virus-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. This test can take up to two days to complete, and, due to the possibility of false negatives, serial testing may be required to reliably exclude infection. A current supply shortage of RT-PCR test kits compounds the shortcomings of entrusting diagnosis to the PCR test alone and underscores the urgent need to provide alternative methods for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value to fully exclude infection, because of the normal radiologic findings in some early disease patients. In this study, we use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history, and/or laboratory testing to more accurately and rapidly diagnose SARS-CoV-2 (+) patients. We included 905 RT-PCR confirmed patients. 419 (46.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by laboratory-confirmed real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing, while 486 patients (53.8%) tested negative (confirmed by at least two additional negative RT-PCR tests and clinical observation).

The proposed scheme builds on the assumption that samples from the population may not be independent of each other. Our simulation results show that the proposed sampling strategy can significantly increase testing capacity under resource constraints: on average, a saving of ~40% tests can be expected assuming a positive test probability of 10% across the given samples.

Methods Epidemiological, clinical, and first laboratory findings after admission of 183 severe COVID-19 patients (115 survivors and 68 nonsurvivors) from the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital were used to develop the predictive models. Five machine learning approaches (logistic regression, partial least squares regression, elastic net, random forest, and bagged flexible discriminant analysis) were used to select the features and predict the patients' outcomes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was applied to compare the models' performance. Sixty-four severe COVID-19 patients from the Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital were used to externally validate the final predictive model. Results The baseline characteristics and laboratory tests were significantly different between the survivors and nonsurvivors. Four variables (age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer level) were selected by all five models. Given the similar performance among the models, the logistic regression model was selected as the final predictive model because of its simplicity and interpretability.

The current global standard used in diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Although the RT-PCR remains the standard reference for diagnosis purposes, it is a time-consuming and expensive test, and moreover, it usually suffers from high rates of false-negatives. Several early works have reported that the sensitivity of the chest Computed Tomography (CT) and the chest X-ray imaging are noticeably greater than that of the RT-PCR test at the initial representations of the disease, making them great candidates for developing new and sophisticated methodologies for analysis and classification of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we establish the use of a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective X-ray-based method as a key diagnosis and screening tool for COVID-19 at early and intermediate stages of the disease. To this end, we develop a novel and sophisticated deep learning-based signal and image processing technique as well as classification methodology for analyzing X-ray images specific to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, we consider a semi-supervised learning methodology based on AutoEncoders to first extract the infected legions in chest X-ray manifestation of COVID-19 and other Pneumonia-like diseases (as well as healthy cases). Then, we utilize this highly-tailored deep architecture to extract the relevant features specific to each class (i.e., healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, and COVID-19) and train a powerful yet efficient classifier to perform the task of automatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the semi-supervised nature of the proposed framework enables us to efficiently exploit the limited available dataset on COVID-19 while exploiting the vast amount of available X-ray dataset for healthy and non-COVID classes. Moreover, such a semi-supervised approach does not require an expert-annotated lesion area for each class. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for COVID-19 identification while employing approximately ten times fewer training parameters as compared to other existing methodologies for classification of the COVID-19 from X-ray images (facilitating efficient training in a limited data regime).

In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence-inspired Model for COVID19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is proposed. AIMDP model has two main functions reflected in two proposed modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module (DM) and Prediction Module (PM). The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID 19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID19 signs obtained from CT scans. The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID19 and contribute in its containment. In addition, some countries have no ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care services, so it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients. In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens. PM implement the Whale Optimization Algorithm for selecting the most relevant patients features. The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed diagnosing and prediction modules, using a dataset with hundreds of real data and CT images.",2020-04-21,Sally M.

In this work, we propose a multitask deep learning model to jointly identify COVID-19 patient and segment COVID-19 lesion from chest CT images.

The causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. Therefore, the S protein presents a viable target to develop a directed therapy. Here, we deployed an integrated artificial intelligence with molecular dynamics simulation approach to provide new details of the S protein structure. Based on a comprehensive structural analysis of S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and previous human coronaviruses, we found that the protomer state of S proteins is structurally flexible. Without the presence of a stabilizing beta sheet from another protomer chain, two regions in the S2 domain and the hinge connecting the S1 and S2 subunits lose their secondary structures. Interestingly, the region in the S2 domain was previously identified as an immunodominant site in the SARS-CoV-1 S protein.

We use neural networks to develop leading indicators based on available data for different regions. These indicators are not only used to assess the risk of a (new) outbreak or to determine the effectiveness of a measure at an early stage, but also in parametric models to determine an effective forecast, along with the associated uncertainty.

One of the most effective strategies in reducing the severity of the pandemic is social distancing, where members of the population systematically reduce their interactions with others to limit the transmission rate of the virus. However, the implementation of social distancing can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand the potential benefits if done correctly and the risks if not. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the effects of social distancing on the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Canada. The model is based upon a standard epidemiological SEIRD model that has been stratified to directly incorporate the proportion of individuals who are following social distancing protocols. The model parameters characterizing the disease are estimated from current epidemiological data on COVID-19 using machine learning techniques. The results of the model show that social distancing policies in Canada have already saved thousands of lives and that the prolonged adherence to social distancing guidelines could save thousands more. Importantly, our model indicates that social distancing can significantly delay the onset of infection peaks, allowing more time for the production of a vaccine or additional medical resources. Furthermore, our results stress the importance of easing social distancing restrictions gradually, rather than all at once, in order to prevent a second wave of infections.

Materials and Methods: We used the publicly available datasets of World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University to create the training dataset, then have used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with gated recurring units (Long Short Term Memory: LSTM units) to create 2 Prediction Models. Information collected in the first t time steps were aggregated with a fully connected (dense) neural network layer and a consequent regression output layer to determine the next predicted value. We used root mean squared logarithmic errors (RMSLE) to compare the predicted and observed data, then recalculated the predictions again.

Considering the widely spread COVID-19, it is of great benefit to develop an automated and accurate system for quantification of COVID-19 associated lung abnormalities using thick-section chest CT images. Purpose: To develop a fully automated AI system to quantitatively assess the disease severity and disease progression using thick-section chest CT images. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a deep learning based system was developed to automatically segment and quantify the COVID-19 infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images. 531 thick-section CT scans from 204 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were collected from one appointed COVID-19 hospital from 23 January 2020 to 12 February 2020. The lung abnormalities were first segmented by a deep learning model. To assess the disease severity (non-severe or severe) and the progression, two imaging bio-markers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU). The performance of lung abnormality segmentation was examined using Dice coefficient, while the assessment of disease severity and the disease progression were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Cohen's kappa statistic, respectively. Results: Dice coefficient between the segmentation of the AI system and the manual delineations of two experienced radiologists for the COVID-19 infected lung abnormalities were 0.74 ± 0.28 and 0.76 ± 0.29, respectively, which were close to the inter-observer agreement, i.e., 0.79 ± 0.25. The computed two imaging bio-markers can distinguish between the severe and non-severe stages with an AUC of 0.9680 (p-value < 0.001). Very good agreement (κ = 0.8220) between the AI system and the radiologists were achieved on evaluating the changes of infection volumes.

Estimating the number of asymptomatic infections has been crucial to understand the virus and contain its spread, which is, however, hard to be accurately counted. Methods: We propose an approach of machine learning based fine-grained simulator (MLSim), which integrates multiple practical factors including disease progress in the incubation period, cross-region population movement, undetected asymptomatic patients, and prevention and containment strength. The interactions among these factors are modeled by virtual transmission dynamics with several undetermined parameters, which are determined from epidemic data by machine learning techniques. When MLSim learns to match the real data closely, it also models the number of asymptomatic patients. MLSim is learned from the open Chinese global epidemic data. Findings: MLSim showed better forecast accuracy than the SEIR and LSTM-based prediction models. The MLSim learned from the data of China's mainland reveals that there could have been 150,408 (142,178-157,417) asymptomatic and had self-healed patients, which is 65% (64% - 65%) of the inferred total infections including undetected ones. The numbers of asymptomatic but infectious patients on April 15, 2020, were inferred as, Italy: 41,387 (29,037 - 57,151), Germany: 21,118 (11,484 - 41,646), USA: 354,657 (277,641 - 495,128), France: 40,379 (10,807 - 186,878), and UK: 144,424 (127,215 - 171,930). To control the virus transmission, the containment measures taken by the government were crucial. The learned MLSim also reveals that if the date of containment measures in China's mainland was postponed for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days later than Jan. 23, there would be 109,039 (129%), 183,930 (218%), 313,342 (371%), 537,555 (637%) confirmed cases on June 12.

Not only do such molecules often fulfil critical biological functions, but also, they may alter the binding of newly designed drugs. In crystal structures, sites consistently occupied in each unit cell yield electron density clouds that represent water molecule presence. These are recorded in virtually all high-resolution structures obtained through X-ray diffraction. In this work, we utilized the wealth of data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank to train a residual deep learning model named ′hotWater′ to identify sites on the surface of proteins that are most likely to bind water, the so-called water hot spots. The model can be used to score existing water molecules from a PDB file to provide their ranking according to the predicted binding strength or to scan the surface of a protein to determine the most likely water hot spots de novo. This is computationally much more efficient than currently used molecular dynamics simulations. Based on testing the model on three example proteins, which have been resolved using both high-resolution X-ray crystallography (providing accurate positions of trapped waters) as well as low-resolution X-ray diffraction, NMR or CryoEM (where structure refinement does not yield water positions), we were able to show that the hotWater method is able to recover in the ″water-free″ structures many water binding sites known from the high-resolution structures. A blind test on a newly solved protein structure with waters removed from the PDB also showed good prediction of the crystal water positions. This was compared to two known algorithms that use electron density and was shown to have higher recall at resolutions >2.6Å. We also show that the algorithm can be applied to novel proteins such as the RNA polymerase complex from SARS-CoV-2, which could be of use in drug discovery.

The goals of this study were to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant epitope hotspot regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA genotypes of approximately 22 000 individuals to develop a digital twin type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population, and used the approach to identify an optimal constellation of epitopes hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have managed to profile the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identify a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population.",2020-04-21,Brandon Malone; Boris Simovski; Clement Moline; Jun Cheng; Marius Gheorghe; Hugues Fontenelle; Ioannis Vardaxis; Simen Tennoe; Jenny-Ann Malmberg; Richard Stratford; Trevor Clancy,,,,,True,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.052084,AI

Fast identification of virus–host interactions can reveal mechanistic insights of infectious diseases and shed light on potential treatments and drug discoveries. Current computational prediction methods for novel viruses are based only on protein sequences. Yet, it is not clear to what extent other important features, such as the symptoms caused by the viruses, could contribute to a predictor. Disease phenotypes (i.e., symptoms) are readily accessible from clinical diagnosis and we hypothesize that they may act as a potential proxy and an additional source of information for the underlying molecular interactions between the pathogens and hosts.ResultsWe developed DeepViral, a deep learning method that predicts potential protein–protein interactions between human and viruses. First, human proteins and viruses were embedded in a shared space using their associated phenotypes, functions, taxonomic classification, as well as formalized background knowledge from biomedical ontologies. By extending a sequence learning model with phenotype features, our model can not only significantly improve over previous sequence-based approaches for inter-species interaction prediction, but also identify pathways of viral targets under a realistic experimental setup for novel viruses.Availabilityhttps://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/DeepViralContactrobert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa",2020-04-25,Wang Liu-Wei; Şenay Kafkas; Jun Chen; Jesper Tegnér; Robert Hoehndorf,,,,,True,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.055095,AI

Amplification of viral RNA by (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the current gold standard test for confirmation of infection, although it presents known shortcomings: long turnaround times (3-4 hours to generate results), potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates as large as 15-20%, the need for certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus there is a need for alternative, faster, less expensive and more accessible tests. Material and methods - We developed two machine learning classification models using hematochemical values from routine blood exams (namely: white blood cells counts, and the platelets, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, LDH plasma levels) drawn from 279 patients who, after being admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) emergency-room with COVID-19 symptoms, were screened with the rRT-PCR test performed on respiratory tract specimens. Of these patients, 177 resulted positive, whereas 102 received a negative response. Results - We have developed two machine learning models, to discriminate between patients who are either positive or negative to the SARS-CoV-2: their accuracy ranges between 82% and 86%, and sensitivity between 92% e 95%, so comparably well with respect to the gold standard. We also developed an interpretable Decision Tree model as a simple decision aid for clinician interpreting blood tests (even off-line) for COVID-19 suspect cases. Discussion - This study demonstrated the feasibility and clinical soundness of using blood tests analysis and machine learning as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19 positive patients. This is especially useful in those countries, like developing ones, suffering from shortages of rRT-PCR reagents and specialized laboratories.

Regression tree, cluster analysis and principal component analysis are implemented to global COVID-19 data of 133 countries obtained from the Worldometer website as reported as on April 17, 2020.

It is also revealed that there are two principal components. The countries which play vital role to explain the 60\% variation of the total variations by the first component characterized by all variables except the rate variables include USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, and Iran.

Models that can assess which individuals are most at risk of being exposed to a pathogen not only provide valuable insights into disease transmission and dynamics but can also guide management interventions. Constructing such models for wild animal populations, however, is particularly challenging; often only serological data is available on a subset of individuals and non-linear relationships between variables are common. Here we take advantage of the latest advances in statistical machine learning to construct pathogen-risk models that automatically incorporate complex non-linear relationships with minimal statistical assumptions from ecological data with missing values. Our approach compares multiple machine learning algorithms in a unified environment to find the model with the best predictive performance and uses game theory to better interpret results. We apply this framework on two major pathogens that infect African lions: canine distemper virus (CDV) and feline parvovirus. Our modelling approach provided enhanced predictive performance compared to more traditional approaches, as well as new insights into disease risks in a wild population. We were able to efficiently capture and visualise strong non-linear patterns, as well as model complex interactions between variables in shaping exposure risk from CDV and feline parvovirus. For example, we found that lions were more likely to be exposed to CDV at a young age but only in low rainfall years. When combined with our data calibration approach, our framework helped us to answer questions about risk of pathogen exposure which are difficult to address with previous methods. Our framework not only has the potential to aid in predicting disease risk in animal populations, but also can be used to build robust predictive models suitable for other ecological applications such as modelling species distribution or diversity patterns.",2019-03-06,Nicholas Fountain-Jones; Gustavo Machado; Scott Carver; Craig Packer; Mariana Mendoza; Meggan E Craft,,,,,True,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/569012,AI

Once the reservoir or intermediate host is known, it can be isolated to prevent further spreading of the viral infection. Recent approaches aim to predict a viral host based on the viral genome, often in combination with the potential host genome and arbitrarily selected features. These methods have a clear limitation in either the number of different hosts they can predict or the accuracy of their prediction.ResultsHere, we present a fast and accurate deep learning approach for viral host prediction, which is based on the viral genome sequence only. To ensure a high prediction accuracy, we developed an effective selection approach for the training data to avoid biases due to a highly unbalanced number of known sequences per virus-host combinations. We tested our deep neural network on three different virus species (influenza A, rabies lyssavirus, rotavirus A). We reached for each virus species an AUG between 0.93 and 0.98, outperforming previous approaches and allowing highly accurate predictions while only using fractions (100-400 bp) of the viral genome sequences. We show that deep neural networks are suitable to predict the host of a virus, even with a limited amount of sequences and highly unbalanced available data. The deep neural networks trained for this approach build the core of the virus-host predicting tool VIDHOP (Virus Deep learning HOst Prediction).AvailabilityThe trained models for the prediction of the host for the viruses influenza A, rabies lyssavirus, rotavirus A are implemented in the tool VIDHOP.

Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest model predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with 90.3% accuracy, compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection, having renal and/or neural tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R0 ≤ 1) human-to-human transmissibility were the strongest predictors of severe disease. We present a novel, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections.Author SummaryNewly emerging infectious diseases present potentially serious threats to global health. Although studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with the emergence of new human diseases, these do not address why emerging infections vary in the severity of disease they cause, often termed ‘virulence’. We test whether ecological traits of human viruses can act as predictors of virulence, as suggested by theoretical studies. We conduct the first systematic review of virulence across all currently known human RNA virus species. We adopt a machine learning approach by constructing a random forest, a model that aims to optimally predict an outcome using a specific structure of predictors. Predictions matched literature-assigned ratings for 28 of 31 test set viruses. Our predictive model suggests that higher virulence is associated with infection of multiple organ systems, nervous systems or the renal systems. Higher virulence was also associated with contact-based or airborne transmission, and limited capability to transmit between humans. These risk factors may provide novel starting points for questioning why virulence should evolve and identifying causative mechanisms of virulence. In addition, our work could suggest priority targets for infectious disease surveillance and future public health risk strategies.BlurbComparative analysis using machine learning shows specificity of tissue tropism and transmission biology can act as predictive risk factors for virulence of human RNA viruses.",2019-03-19,Liam Brierley; Amy B.

The virome with the human-infection potential is far from complete. Novel viruses have been discovered at an unprecedented pace as the rapid development of viral metagenomics. However, there is still a lack of a method for rapidly identifying the virus with the human-infection potential. This study built several machine learning models for discriminating the human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences. The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model could predict the human-infecting virus with an accuracy of over 90%. Even for the KNN models built on the contigs as short as 1kb, they performed comparably to those built on the viral genomes, suggesting that the models could be used to identify the human-infecting virus from the viral metagenomic sequences.

Many estimation methods require linking cases by direct transmission, a difficult task for most diseases.MethodsUsing a subset of cases with detailed genetic or contact investigation data to develop a training set of probable transmission events, we build a model to estimate the relative transmission probability for all case-pairs from demographic, spatial and clinical data. Our method is based on naive Bayes, a machine learning classification algorithm which uses the observed frequencies in the training dataset to estimate the probability that a pair is linked given a set of covariates.ResultsIn simulations we find that the probabilities estimated using genetic distance between cases to define training transmission events are able to distinguish between truly linked and unlinked pairs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve value of 95%). Additionally only a subset of the cases, 10-50% depending on sample size, need to have detailed genetic data for our method to perform well. We show how these probabilities can be used to estimate the average effective reproductive number and apply our method to a tuberculosis outbreak in Hamburg, Germany.ConclusionsOur method is a novel way to infer transmission dynamics in any dataset when only a subset of cases has rich contact investigation and/or genetic data.KEY MESSAGESThis method provides a way to calculate the relative probability that two infectious disease patients are connected by direct transmission using clinical, demographic, geographic, and genetic characteristics.We use a naïve Bayes, a machine learning technique to estimate these probabilities using a training set of probable links defined by contact investigation or pathogen WGS data on a subset of cases.These probabilities can be used to explore possible transmission chains, rule out transmission events, and estimate the reproductive number.",2019-04-26,Sarah V Leavitt; Robyn S Lee; Paola Sebastiani; Charles R.

Drug repurposing can avoid the expensive and lengthy process of drug development by finding new uses for already approved drugs. In order to repurpose drugs effectively, it is useful to know which proteins are targeted by which drugs. Computational models that estimate the interaction strength of new drug–target pairs have the potential to expedite drug repurposing. Several models have been proposed for this task. However, these models represent the drugs as strings, which is not a natural way to represent molecules. We propose a new model called GraphDTA that represents drugs as graphs and uses graph neural networks to predict drug–target affinity. We show that graph neural networks not only predict drug–target affinity better than non-deep learning models, but also outperform competing deep learning methods. Our results confirm that deep learning models are appropriate for drug–target binding affinity prediction, and that representing drugs as graphs can lead to further improvements.Availability of data and materialsThe proposed models are implemented in Python.

The mechanisms that lead to mortality in these children are poorly understood. Studies of the cellular immunology of the infant airway have traditionally been hindered by the limited sample volumes available from the young, frail children who are admitted to hospital with pneumonia. This is further compounded by the relatively low frequencies of certain immune cell phenotypes that are thought to be critical to the clinical outcome of pneumonia. To address this, we developed a novel in-silico deconvolution method for inferring the frequencies of immune cell phenotypes in the airway of children with different survival outcomes using proteomic data.MethodsUsing high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified > 1,000 proteins expressed in the airways of children who were admitted to hospital with clinical pneumonia. 61 of these children were discharged from hospital and survived for more than 365 days after discharge, while 19 died during admission. We used machine learning by random forest to derive protein features that could be used to deconvolve immune cell phenotypes in paediatric airway samples. We applied these phenotype-specific signatures to identify airway-resident immune cell phenotypes that were differentially enriched by survival status and validated the findings using a large retrospective pneumonia cohort.Main ResultsWe identified immune-cell phenotype classification features for 33 immune cell types. Eosinophil-associated features were significantly elevated in airway samples obtained from pneumonia survivors and were downregulated in children who subsequently died. To confirm these results, we analyzed clinical parameters from >10,000 children who had been admitted with pneumonia in the previous 10 years. The results of this retrospective analysis mirrored airway deconvolution data and showed that survivors had significantly elevated eosinophils at admission compared to fatal pneumonia.ConclusionsUsing a proteomics bioinformatics approach, we identify airway eosinophils as a critical factor for pneumonia survival in infants and young children.",2019-11-13,Charles J Sande; Jacqueline M Waeni; James M Njunge; Martin N Mutunga; Elijah Gicheru; Nelson K Kibinge; Agnes Gwela,,,,,True,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/840090,AI

Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined.

As of 9 February 2020, there now have been at least 813 deaths from a novel strain of coronavirus that is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China (2019-nCoV), at the end of 2019. These deaths are in the context of the 37 558 cases of 2019-nCov which have already been diagnosed in China and multiple other countries.1 In the United Kingdom (UK), recent research by University College London, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, has found that 1 in 20 UK teachers now report long-lasting mental health problems, illustrating a dramatic increase from around 1/100 teachers affected in this way in the 1990s.2 In the United States (US), a recent report by Accenture (Artificial Intelligence [AI]: Healthcare's new nervous system), estimates that AI in health will be worth around $6.6 billion by 2021 and that “…when combined, key clinical health AI applications can potentially create $150 billion in annual savings for the US healthcare economy by 2026.”3 What do these facts and statistics have in common? Taken together they illustrate the massive range and rate of change in health and the responsibility of healthcare globally. In this context a valid question can be asked about the role of general medical journals such as the International Journal of Clinical Practice (IJCP). Having taken over as Editor in Chief of IJCP in January this year, I have the honour of leading an internationally renowned medical journal, with a team of extremely accomplished clinician editors, published by Wiley, one of the world's leading biomedical publishers. In our rapidly changing healthcare world, IJCP is eager, committed and ideally suited to undergo a transition process as well. As a team, our view is that in a healthcare environment of seemingly ever-increasing specialisation, one key role that a Journal such as ours should move to fulfil is to publish important, high quality medical research and opinion that will inform specialist clinicians about important general medical concepts, practical insights and recent advances. Similarly, we will also aim to inform generalists about key speciality medical advances that have relevance to generalists in the provision of care to their patients. In this work a foundational aspect of our editorial approach will be rather than looking for reasons to reject submissions, to clearly identify problems with submitted research and opinion if they exist, and work closely with authors to address these issues, allowing those authors to raise the quality of their work to the highest level. In that context, as well as continuing to publish submissions from internationally important clinicians and medical researchers worldwide, we also see that IJCP should aim to specifically encourage less experienced authors who nonetheless have important information to share with the global healthcare community. In this way, IJCP will drive forward its primary function of improving global health through the dissemination of world leading medical information and debate.

The problem began in 2018 when unusually heavy rains on the Arabian Peninsula allowed populations to boom over several generations. In October 2019, the locusts swarmed south into Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia, and in late December, they spread to Kenya, causing the worst infestation there in 70 years. Somalia—which last week declared a national emergency and asked for increased food aid—has already lost 100,000 hectares of crops and pasture. Another generation of locusts will likely hatch this month and cause more damage. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations called for $70 million to fight the outbreak with pesticides and help farmers. ### Glaciology After dropping sensors and a torpedo-shaped robot through a 700-meter hole in the ice, scientists in Antarctica last week revealed the first direct evidence that warm ocean temperatures around the rapidly retreating Thwaites Glacier could destabilize the key ice sheet. Researchers are worried because Thwaites—larger than the state of Illinois—helps block the ocean from reaching and warming the even bigger, unstable West Antarctic Ice Sheet, whose melting could eventually drive meters of sea level rise. Battling 2 months of stormy conditions, the team measured ocean waters beneath Thwaites at more than 2°C above the freezing point. The robot, Icefin (above, shown operating elsewhere in Antarctica), provided the first images of the glacier's grounding zone, the mysterious boundary where the floating coastal ice sheet attaches to bedrock. The project is part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a multiyear effort by the United States and the United Kingdom that is wrapping up its first full field season. ### Leadership Some researchers in Colombia are calling for a little-known molecular biologist appointed as the country's first ever science minister to resign. They are outraged by reports that she treated cancer patients with a fungal extract, without running a formal clinical trial. “We can only regret that the course of how to do science in our country has been left in the hands of pseudoscience,” the Colombian Association of Medical Faculties wrote in a statement. In December 2019, Mabel Gisela Torres Torres was appointed to lead the newly created Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. In January, she told a newspaper she did not seek formal ethical, safety, and efficacy reviews of her work with patients because she believed the fungus posed no threat to human health. Her Ph.D. adviser has defended her and notes that metabolites in the fungi Torres studied have shown potential as a cancer treatment in cell and mouse studies. ### Environmental science ![Figure][2] CREDITS: (GRAPHIC) J. BRAINARD/ SCIENCE ; (DATA) UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE FOR WATER, ENVIRONMENT, AND HEALTH The world's growing flows of wastewater offer a largely untapped, potentially lucrative source of energy, agricultural fertilizers, and water for irrigation, a comprehensive study says. The opportunities will increase as the annual volume of wastewater—now 380 billion cubic meters—expands by an estimated 51% by 2050, as populations and incomes multiply, says a team led by researchers at United Nations University's Institute for Water, Environment, and Health. About 13% of global demand for fertilizer could be met by recovering nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash from wastewater; such use provides a bonus, diverting nutrients from waterways, where they can create harmful eutrophication. Sewage also offers an alternative energy source. The need to plan and finance such recovery efforts is greatest in “low- and middle-income countries, where most municipal wastewater still goes into the environment untreated,” says the study, published 27 January in Natural Resources Forum. ### Conservation A decision by South Africa's government to allow breeding and genetic research on more than 30 wild species—including rhinos, lions, and cheetahs—could considerably reduce their genetic diversity, scientists warned last week. The government's action has been interpreted to allow breeders to select for commercially desirable traits, such as longer horns or larger body size; that could create genetic bottlenecks by promoting a few stud lines, the researchers wrote in the South African Journal of Science. They added that it may prove expensive or impossible to keep the intensively bred animals from mating with wild counterparts. A handful of game ranchers requested the policy, which South Africa announced in May 2019 without consulting the public or studying potential consequences. Game ranching —for hunting, meat, and tourism—already occupies more than 15% of the country, and the government wants to expand the industry. ### Funding The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) announced this week seven winners in its contest for “big ideas” to address societal problems. Four winning teams will receive $26,000 each to develop ideas on topics ranging from using artificial intelligence for complex problem-solving to developing small-scale technologies that sequester carbon dioxide. Three more teams earned $10,000 as runners-up. The 2026 Idea Machine contest attracted almost 800 submissions, and although some high schoolers made it to the semifinals, all the winners work at research institutions. NSF hopes to fund workshops and exploratory grants to further develop these and other ideas from contestants. ### Publishing A software company said last week it has teamed up with publishing giant Wiley to roll out in mid-2020 a tool that can signal whether findings in Wiley's scientific papers are reproducible. The software, called [Scite.ai][3], uses artificial intelligence to examine articles that cite a paper, and determines and displays whether they provide evidence supporting or contradicting the paper's findings. Users can browse and search the relevant text of the citing articles. Scite CEO Josh Nicholson says the software allows users to home in on articles that attempted to reproduce a study; of every 100 citations analyzed, Scite has found that 94 merely note the paper cited. The addition of Wiley's articles will expand Scite's current trove of more than 14 million papers from other publishers, most in the biomedical sciences. Nicholson expects his company to sign agreements with additional publishers to analyze their articles. ### Biomedicine The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) said this week it will award $13.5 million to 30 patient advocacy groups to support their work finding treatments for rare diseases. Of an estimated 7000 rare diseases, fewer than 5% have treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Each group will receive $450,000 over 2 years as well as training and mentoring as part of the foundation's Rare As One Project, launched last year to help advocates develop networks of patients, clinicians, and scientists. Most of the diseases are autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and other inherited disorders, but the list of diseases also includes rare cancers. CZI, founded by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan, his wife, has made a few other awards to rare disease groups. The initiative expected to make just 10 Rare As One awards but tripled the number after receiving 275 applications. ### Conservation The Trump administration proposed last week to end penalties on owners of open oil storage ponds and other industrial operations that kill birds accidentally. The administration will instead encourage voluntary efforts to protect birds. Conservation groups cried foul, saying the change to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 will only embolden companies to take actions that threaten vulnerable species. ### BRAIN Initiative gets leader Since its launch in 2013, the U.S. Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative has doled out about $1.3 billion to develop tools that map and manipulate the brain. Until now, the multiagency effort has had no formal director. But last week, neurobiologist John Ngai of the University of California, Berkeley, was named to take the helm in March. (A longer version of the interview is at <https://scim.ag/BRAINdirector>.) > Q: Why is BRAIN getting a director? > A:The initiative has been run day to day by a terrific team of senior program directors and staff with oversight from the 10 [U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)] institutes and centers that are involved in BRAIN. I think as enterprises emerge from their startup phase, the question is how do you translate this into a sustainable enterprise, and yet maintain this cutting-edge innovation? … The initiative really will benefit from somebody thinking about this 24/7. > Q: What distinguishes this second phase of BRAIN? > A:In the first phase, there was a very intentional and concentrated focus on tool development. As we learn more about how neural circuits drive behavior … we can start implementing that knowledge, in terms of treating human diseases. I am hopeful that BRAIN, with other efforts in NIH and in partnership with industry, [can create] technology platforms that could be applied across multiple disease applications. For example: a toolkit of different types of viral delivery vectors [for gene therapy] that could be applied to different parts of the brain, different cell types in the brain, and so on. > Q: What do you see as the initiative's shortcomings? > A:We have a lot of figuring out to do in terms of how to balance the unique potential of individual investigator-initiated research versus the power of large-scale projects. … [And] there is a diversity issue in terms of ethnic diversity as well as gender diversity [among applicants and funded investigators].

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.",2020-04-06,Feng Shi; Jun Wang; Jun Shi; Ziyan Wu; Qian Wang; Zhenyu Tang; Kelei He; Yinghuan Shi; Dinggang Shen,,,,2004.02731,True,False,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02731,AI

However, if we had data from other on-going clinical trials and volunteers, we may do much more.

As a challenge to the engineering community and in the context of our clinical trial, the authors suggest distributing cough recordings daily, hoping other trials and crowdsourcing users will contribute more data. Previous approaches to complex AI tasks have either used a static dataset or were private efforts led by large corporations. All existing COVID-19 trials published also follow this paradigm. Instead, we suggest a novel open collective approach to large-scale real-time health care AI. We will be posting updates at https://opensigma.mit.edu.

Since pulmonary infections can be observed through radiography images, this paper investigates deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest X-ray images with the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the COVID-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients. In this context, training datasets, deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from publicly open sets of chest X-ray images. Tailored deep learning models are proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases, notably viral cases. It is assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic COVID-19 context have a high probability to presume COVID-19 infections. Moreover, easy-to-apply health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting patient status from the detected pneumonia cases. Experimental results show possibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest X-ray images towards screening viral pneumonia.

To date the novel COVID-19 coronavirus is rapidly spreading worldwide and subsequently threatening health of billions of humans. Clinical studies have shown that most COVID-19 patients suffer from the lung infection. Although chest CT has been shown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis, chest Xray is more widely available due to its faster imaging time and considerably lower cost than CT. Deep learning, one of the most successful AI techniques, is an effective means to assist radiologists to analyze the vast amount of chest X-ray images, which can be critical for efficient and reliable COVID-19 screening. In this work, we aim to develop a new deep anomaly detection model for fast, reliable screening. To evaluate the model performance, we have collected 100 chest X-ray images of 70 patients confirmed with COVID-19 from the Github repository. To facilitate deep learning, more data are needed. Thus, we have also collected 1431 additional chest X-ray images confirmed as other pneumonia of 1008 patients from the public ChestX-ray14 dataset.

In this paper, we propose an explainable deep neural networks(DNN)-based method for automatic detection of COVID-19 symptoms from CXR images, which we call 'DeepCOVIDExplainer'. We used 16,995 CXR images across 13,808 patients, covering normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. CXR images are first comprehensively preprocessed, before being augmented and classified with a neural ensemble method, followed by highlighting class-discriminating regions using gradient-guided class activation maps(Grad-CAM++) and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP). Further, we provide human-interpretable explanations of the predictions. Evaluation results based on hold-out data show that our approach can identify COVID-19 confidently with a positive predictive value(PPV) of 89.61% and recall of 83%, improving over recent comparable approaches.

The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is the tried-and-true polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but PCR is a laborious, time-consuming and complicated manual process that is in short supply. Deep learning based computer-aided screening, e.g., infection segmentation, is thus viewed as an alternative due to its great successes in medical imaging. However, the publicly available COVID-19 training data are limited, which would easily cause overfitting of traditional deep learning methods that are usually data-hungry with millions of parameters. On the other hand, fast training/testing and low computational cost are also important for quick deployment and development of computer-aided COVID-19 screening systems, but traditional deep learning methods, especially for image segmentation, are usually computationally intensive. To address the above problems, we propose MiniSeg, a lightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation. Compared with traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant strengths: i) it only has 472K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii) it has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private COVID-19 data for further improving performance.

However, viruses often evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral HLA peptides presented on virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. Here we propose a personalized workflow to identify an optimal set of T-cell epitopes based on the HLA alleles and the immunopeptidome of an individual person. Specifically, our workflow trains a machine learning model on the immunopeptidome and then predicts HLA peptides from conserved regions of a virus that are most likely to trigger responses from the person T cells.

It is confirmed that this virus has taken over 126,607 lives until today. Since the beginning of its spreading, many Artificial Intelligence researchers developed systems and methods for predicting the virus's behavior or detecting the infection. One of the possible ways of determining the patient infection to COVID-19 is through analyzing the chest X-ray images. As there are a large number of patients in hospitals, it would be time-consuming and difficult to examine lots of X-ray images, so it can be very useful to develop an AI network that does this job automatically. In this paper, we have trained several deep convolutional networks with the introduced training techniques for classifying X-ray images into three classes: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19, based on two open-source datasets. Unfortunately, most of the previous works on this subject have not shared their dataset, and we had to deal with few data on covid19 cases. Our data contains 180 X-ray images that belong to persons infected to COVID-19, so we tried to apply methods to achieve the best possible results. In this research, we introduce some training techniques that help the network learn better when we have few cases of COVID-19, and also we propose a neural network that is a concatenation of Xception and ResNet50V2 networks. This network achieved the best accuracy by utilizing multiple features extracted by two robust networks. In this paper, despite some other researches, we have tested our network on 11302 images to report the actual accuracy our network can achieve in real circumstances.

Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present, there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end, this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD) and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD).

Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques.

In this vision paper we propose CovidSens, the concept of social-sensing-based risk alerting systems to notify the general public about the COVID-19 spread. The CovidSens concept is motivated by two recent observations: 1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, and 2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media. We anticipate an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the social media users to build a real-time analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions of: how to track the spread of the COVID-19? How to distill reliable information about the disease with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively and alert them to remain prepared? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in implementing reliable social-sensing-based risk alerting systems.

An agile, scalable and cost-effective testing, deployable at a global scale, can act as a game changer in this war. To address this challenge, building on the promising results of our prior work on cough-based diagnosis of a motley of respiratory diseases, we develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based test for COVID-19 preliminary diagnosis. The test is deployable at scale through a mobile app named AI4COVID-19. The AI4COVID-19 app requires 2-second cough recordings of the subject. By analyzing the cough samples through an AI engine running in the cloud, the app returns a preliminary diagnosis within a minute. Unfortunately, cough is common symptom of over two dozen non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the COVID-19 diagnosis from cough alone an extremely challenging problem. We solve this problem by developing a novel multi-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture that minimizes misdiagnosis. At the time of writing, our AI engine can distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with over 90% accuracy. AI4COVID-19's performance is likely to improve as more and better data becomes available. This paper presents a proof of concept to encourage controlled clinical trials and serves as a call for labeled cough data. AI4COVID-19 is not designed to compete with clinical testing. Instead, it offers a complementing tele-testing tool deployable anytime, anywhere, by anyone, so clinical-testing and treatment can be channeled to those who need it the most, thereby saving more lives.",2020-04-02,Ali Imran; Iryna Posokhova; Haneya Qureshi N.; Usama Masood; Sajid Riaz; Kamran Ali; Charles John N.; Muhammad Nabeel,,,,2004.01275,True,False,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01275,AI

As a consequence, there are disruptions in human and economic activities all over the globe. The recovery process is also expected to be rough. Economic activities impact social behaviors, which leave signatures in satellite images that can be automatically detected and classified. Satellite imagery can support the decision-making of analysts and policymakers by providing a different kind of visibility into the unfolding economic changes. Such information can be useful both during the crisis and also as we recover from it. In this work, we use a deep learning approach that combines strategic location sampling and an ensemble of lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize specific elements in satellite images and compute economic indicators based on it, automatically. This CNN ensemble framework ranked third place in the US Department of Defense xView challenge, the most advanced benchmark for object detection in satellite images. We show the potential of our framework for temporal analysis using the US IARPA Function Map of the World (fMoW) dataset. We also show results on real examples of different sites before and after the COVID-19 outbreak to demonstrate possibilities. Among the future work is the possibility that with a satellite image dataset that samples a region at a weekly (or biweekly) frequency, we can generate more informative temporal signatures that can predict future economic states.

The best performing models are iteratively pruned to identify optimal number of neurons in the convolutional layers to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. The custom and pretrained CNNs are evaluated at the patient-level to alleviate issues due to information leakage and reduce generalization errors. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs as compared to the individual constituent models.

We applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure. RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020.

The current diagnostic procedure of COVID-19 follows reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based approach which however is less sensitive to identify the virus at the initial stage. Hence, a more robust and alternate diagnosis technique is desirable. Recently, with the release of publicly available datasets of corona positive patients comprising of computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) imaging; scientists, researchers and healthcare experts are contributing for faster and automated diagnosis of COVID-19 by identifying pulmonary infections using deep learning approaches to achieve better cure and treatment. These datasets have limited samples concerned with the positive COVID-19 cases, which raise the challenge for unbiased learning. Following from this context, this article presents the random oversampling and weighted class loss function approach for unbiased fine-tuned learning (transfer learning) in various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as baseline ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNet-v2, DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge to perform binary classification (as normal and COVID-19 cases) and also multi-class classification (as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal case) of posteroanterior CXR images. Accuracy, precision, recall, loss, and area under the curve (AUC) are utilized to evaluate the performance of the models. Considering the experimental results, the performance of each model is scenario dependent; however, NASNetLarge displayed better scores in contrast to other architectures. This article also added the visual explanation to illustrate the basis of model classification and perception of COVID-19 in CXR images.",2020-04-23,Narinder Punn Singh; Sonali Agarwal,,,,,True,False,arxiv,,AI

With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques (RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity. Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further, we propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients using X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology scalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural network based model to triage patients for appropriate testing.

Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives. Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases.

According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory pattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the common cold. One significant symptom that occurs in the COVID-19 is Tachypnea. People infected with COVID-19 have more rapid respiration. Our study can be utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be preliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in situations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online. Research details: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work, we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. Subsequently, we first apply a GRU neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify 6 clinically significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots, Cheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea).

Recently, Broniatowski et al. found that foreign powers, and especially Russia, were implicated in information operations using public health crises to promote discord -- including racial conflict -- in American society (Broniatowski, 2018). This brief considers the problem of automatically detecting changes in overall attitudes, that may be associated with emerging information operations, via artificial intelligence. Accurate analysis of these emerging topics usually requires laborious, manual analysis by experts to annotate millions of tweets to identify biases in new topics. We introduce extensions of the Word Embedding Association Test from Caliskan et. al to a new domain (Caliskan, 2017). This practical and unsupervised method is applied to quantify biases being promoted in information operations. Analyzing historical information operations from Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, we quantify biased attitudes for presidential candidates, and sentiment toward Muslim groups. We next apply this method to a corpus of tweets containing anti-Chinese hashtags. We find that roughly 1% of tweets in our corpus reference Russian-funded news sources and use anti-Chinese hashtags and, beyond the expected anti-Chinese attitudes, we find that this corpus as a whole contains pro-Russian attitudes, which are not present in a control Twitter corpus containing general tweets. Additionally, 4% of the users in this corpus were suspended within a week. These findings may indicate the presence of abusive account activity associated with rapid changes in attitudes around the COVID-19 public health crisis, suggesting potential information operations.",2020-04-18,Autumn Toney; Akshat Pandey; Wei Guo; David Broniatowski; Aylin Caliskan,,,,2004.08726,True,False,arxiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08726,AI

As the number of affected patients increase rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age 45.3$\\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used, from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity (non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left lung.

Most of the existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. In this paper, we created a COVID-19 3D CT dataset with 20 cases that contains 1800+ annotated slices and made it publicly available. To promote the development of annotation-efficient deep learning methods, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation that contain current main research interests, e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide unified training, validation and testing dataset splits, and evaluation metrics and corresponding code. In addition, we provided more than 40 pre-trained baseline models for the benchmarks, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation.

COVID-19 is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test, however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models. COVID-CAPS achieved an Accuracy of 95.7%, Sensitivity of 90%, Specificity of 95.8%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, while having far less number of trainable parameters in comparison to its counterparts.

The performance of the system was evaluated by comparing the automatically segmented infection regions with the manually-delineated ones on 300 chest CT scans of 300 COVID-19 patients. For fast manual delineation of training samples and possible manual intervention of automatic results, a human-in-the-loop (HITL) strategy has been adopted to assist radiologists for infection region segmentation, which dramatically reduced the total segmentation time to 4 minutes after 3 iterations of model updating.

Researchers around the world have been looking for alternative screening methods. In this context, deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing promising results in the identification of COVID-19.

From an initial individual (the patient zero), the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates, creating new populations of infected people. Every individual can either die or infect and, afterwards, be sent to the recovered population. Relevant terms such as re-infection probability, super-spreading rate or traveling rate are introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity. The Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability of ending after several iterations, without setting this value either. Infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some iterations, when considering social isolation measures and the high number recovered and dead people, the number of infected people starts decreasing in subsequent iterations. Furthermore, a parallel multi-virus version is proposed in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations. Finally, the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models, in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase.

This raised the question: is mass quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t)>1 to R(t)<1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March 2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction number at R(t)<1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t)>1.

Automated segmentation is still an open problem, especially for scans with substantial abnormalities, such as in COVID-19 infection. Recent works used Convolutional Neural Networks for automatic pulmonary lobe segmentation. Convolution kernels in these networks only respond to local information within the scope of their effective receptive field, and this may be insufficient to capture all necessary contextual information. We argue that contextual information is critically important for accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes, especially when the lungs are severely affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a contextual two-stage U-net (CTSU-Net) that leverages global context by introducing a first stage in which the receptive field encompasses the entire scan and by using a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module computes the filter response at one position as a weighted sum of feature responses at all positions, where geometric and visual correlations between features determine weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate CTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models pretrained COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate CTSU-Net on 204 COVID-19 subjects (104 for retraining and 100 for evaluation).

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest way to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 97\\%($\\pm$ 5\\%), while having a specificity rate of around 90\\%. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates.

Many drug therapy developments consist in investigating through different clinical trials the effects of different specific drug combinations by delivering it into a test group of ill patients, meanwhile a placebo treatment is delivered to the remaining ill patients, known as the control group. We compare the above technique to a new technique in which all patients receive a different and reasonable combination of drugs and use this outcome to feed a Neural Network. By averaging out fluctuations and recognizing different patient features, the Neural Network learns the pattern that connects the patients initial state to the outcome of the treatments and therefore can predict the best drug therapy better than the above method. In contrast to many available works, we do not study any detail of drugs composition nor interaction, but instead pose and solve the problem from a phenomenological point of view, which allows us to compare both methods.

Further, authorities use case quarantine strategy and manual second/third contact-tracing to contain the COVID-19 disease. However, manual contact tracing is time consuming and labor-intensive task which tremendously overload public health systems. In this paper, we developed a smartphone-based approach to automatically and widely trace the contacts for confirmed COVID-19 cases. Particularly, contact-tracing approach creates a list of individuals in the vicinity and notifying contacts or officials of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This approach is not only providing awareness to individuals they are in the proximity to the infected area, but also tracks the incidental contacts that the COVID-19 carrier might not recall. Thereafter, we developed a dashboard to provide a plan for government officials on how lockdown/mass quarantine can be safely lifted, and hence tackling the economic crisis.

However, robust and accurate screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays is still a globally recognized challenge because of two bottlenecks: 1) imaging features of COVID-19 share some similarities with other pneumonia on chest X-rays, and 2) the misdiagnosis rate of COVID-19 is very high, and the misdiagnosis cost is expensive. While a few pioneering works have made much progress, they underestimate both crucial bottlenecks. In this paper, we report our solution, discriminative cost-sensitive learning (DCSL), which should be the choice if the clinical needs the assisted screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays. DCSL combines both advantages from fine-grained classification and cost-sensitive learning. Firstly, DCSL develops a conditional center loss that learns deep discriminative representation. Secondly, DCSL establishes score-level cost-sensitive learning that can adaptively enlarge the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 examples into other classes. DCSL is so flexible that it can apply in any deep neural network. We collected a large-scale multi-class dataset comprised of 2,239 chest X-ray examples: 239 examples from confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,000 examples with confirmed bacterial or viral pneumonia cases, and 1,000 examples of healthy people.

However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, these developed AI systems have been closed source and unavailable to the research community for deeper understanding and extension, and unavailable for public access and use.

The utility of the noncontrast CT chest in the diagnosis of COVID-19 has been controversial, but there are specific imaging findings that have been increasingly associated with this virus in the appropriate clinical context. The stages of imaging findings in COVID-19 are considered along with the implications of fibrosis throughout the stages. Future considerations include using artificial intelligence algorithms to distinguish between community acquired pneumonias and COVID-19 infection.",2020-04-20,"Adair, Luther B.; Ledermann, Eric J.",Radiol Case Rep,,,,True,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182697/,AI

I wish to emphasize and thank the Guest Editors of this special issue, Yvan Saeys and Greg Finak, for their outstanding success and hard work to assemble excellent manuscripts for this issue. I am referring to their guest editorial giving you more details on aims and scopes and elaborating on specific articles. I started drafting this editorial while attending the annual Photonics West conference in San Francisco, presumably the largest showcase on photonics technologies and instrumentation. Scientifically, the sub‐conference BIOS demonstrated the broadness and vividness of photonics technologies in life sciences and particularly in single cell analysis. When searching for relevant literature for this editorial, I was also tracking the actual global developments. This brought me to change my focus and comment on some issues that are relevant to our field and somewhat related to that of the special issue. First of all, Nature Methods announced their Method of the Year 2019 1. It is: “Single‐cell multimodal omics” and acknowledges (among others) the important contribution of highly multiplexed flow cytometry and cell sorting to the increased understanding of single cell biology and cell systems. This is motivating and confirms that cytometry is receiving the focus of attention. Concurrently, in the last weeks the relevance of the recent COVID‐19 (2019‐nCoV) outbreak and its effects started to become evident as everybody was monitoring the number of cases registered globally 2. As conference chairs, we were facing the fact that many of our speakers and colleagues became unavailable. Not only that, but the eeriness of the infection (it is transmissible already during its asymptomatic latency period of up to two weeks, recent results indicate even longer) gave many attendees an uneasy feeling. This brings me to two points worth discussing. (a) Are large scale conferences with global attendance still state of the art or should they be rethought; and (b) to what extent can cytometry support global efforts in various fields of epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases? In the past one to two decades the world faced several outbreaks of different viral infections that were luckily not as disastrous as initially anticipated but still claimed victims. These were coronaviruses such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in 2002/2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) with occasional outbreaks since 2012 or influenza viruses like the H1N1 pandemic in 2009/2010. It is only a matter of time until other pandemics follow. Global travel for work and leisure supports viral spread and can transport the infection to nearly all places of the globe within days. Global conferences contribute to such a rapid spread and one should reconsider this model of scientific exchange from time to time and scrutinize potential alternatives. Models for sustainable international conferences are under testing and combine venues in close proximity to institutions with a substantial expertise on the focus area of the conference with virtual participation and contribution by internet for participants on more distant places. Although personal meetings are essential for optimal information exchange, a reduction in travel would not only reduce the risk of dissemination of disease but, as a side effect, could result in budgetary savings, reduce travel‐related emissions (in the wake of Greta), and eliminate jetlag. Now, what can Cytometry do for help in pandemics? Cytometry has already supported several achievements as a quick and non‐representative literature search shows. Image cytometry methods 3 and bead‐based flow cytometry methods 4 are at hand to enable for screening and detecting antibody virus interactions and detect viral antigens. Airway memory T‐cells and viral E protein mutations have been identified in CoV infections a potential targets for vaccine strategies 5, 6. Immune responses seem to be indicative of disease severity 6, 7 but more studies are needed to have a practical assay for decision making at hand. In fact, easy to use and rapid assays derived from Cytomics or multi‐OMICS approaches are needed to rapidly distinguish severe from mild cases and identify future critically ill individuals before symptom onset. Such a test would clearly take the pressure off of the clinicians because only those with high probability to becoming critically ill would receive intensive care early. Hopefully we will see more related studies in this journal in the near future.",2020-03-06,"Tárnok, Attila",Cytometry A,2949717189.0,#5479,,True,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162219/,AI

In addition, the system was also designed to deal with the variability in age and gender, which would affect the accuracy of the detection. Furthermore, to enable a low-cost, non-contact and embedded system, multiple vital signs from a medical radar were measured and all algorithms were implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array, named PYNQ-Z1. Methods The system consisted of two main stages: digital signal processing and data classification. In the former stage, Butterworth filters, with flexible cut-off frequencies depending on age and gender, and a time-domain peak detection algorithm were deployed to compute three vital signs, namely heart rate, respiratory rate, and standard deviation of heart beat-to-beat interval. For the classification problem, two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, were implemented. Results The Student's t-test showed that our proposed digital signal processing algorithms coped well with the variability of human cases in age and gender. Meanwhile, the f1-score of roughly 98.0% represented the high sensitivity and specificity of our proposed machine learning methods. Conclusion This study outlines the implementation of an infection screening system, which achieved competent performance. The system might be beneficial for fast screening of infected patients at public health centers in underdeveloped areas, where people have little access to healthcare.",2019-12-31,"Nguyen, Cuong V.; Le Quang, Truong; Vu, Trung Nguyen; Le Thi, Hoi; Van, Kinh Nguyen; Trong, Thanh Han; Trong, Tuan Do; Sun, Guanghao; Ishibashi, Koichiro",Informatics in Medicine Unlocked,,,,True,False,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2019.100225,AI

We identified a group of approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells (appendix). The drug targets are members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family—including AAK1 and GAK—the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro.

It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecastingmodel for the highest possible accuracy.

The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. Methods The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, naïve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. Result The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spite of MERS being a zoonotic disease, contact with camels is not a major factor influencing recovery.

It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning based data collection and analytical tools are maturing. Interdisciplinary studies that incorporate such advances may lead to the formation of innovative sustainable soil use and management strategies that are aimed toward optimizing soil health and achieving the SDGs.",2020-08-10,"Hou, Deyi; Bolan, Nanthi S.; Tsang, Daniel C.W.; Kirkham, Mary B.; O'Connor, David",Science of The Total Environment,,,,True,False,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138961,AI

Infectious diseases may be asymptomatic in some individuals but may lead to disastrous effects in others. Despite the advances in medicine, infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in low-income countries. With the advent of mathematical tools, scientists are now able to better predict epidemics, understand the specificity of each pathogen, and identify potential targets for drug development. Artificial intelligence and its components have been widely publicized for their ability to better diagnose certain types of cancer from imaging data.
